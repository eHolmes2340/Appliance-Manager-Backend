GE manufactured 3.1 million of these dishwashers between 1983 and 1989.In the recall announced last year, GE provided consumers with a rebate toward the purchase of a new dishwasher. CPSC and GE are announcing the supplemental rewiring option to increase the effectiveness of the original program, which has to date been implemented in over 628,000 units. CPSC and GE are cooperating in an effort to reach people who may not have previously come forward.Both the CPSC and GE strongly urge consumers who have not replaced their recalled units under the original rebate program to contact GE right away to schedule a free rewiring or participate in the original rebate program. Until the dishwasher has been rewired, consumers should keep the dishwasher door unlatched at all times to prevent the flow of electrical current that creates a risk of fire.The slide switch allows consumers to choose between heated drying and ""energy saver"" functions. Over time, the slide switch can melt and ignite, presenting a fire hazard. In the free rewiring program announced today, GE-authorized technicians will rewire the slide switch, eliminating it from the electrical circuit and thereby eliminating the fire risk.There have been approximately 90 incidents of fire, smoking and melted switches, 14 of which included fires that spread beyond the dishwasher.

Although some manufacturers had freezers that were in compliance prior to the 1970 standards, most old chest freezers have latches that can trap a child. Children playing ""hide-and-seek"" have found the non-working freezers a deadly place to hide. When the lid closes, children can become trapped inside and suffocate - usually in less than ten minutes.&nbsp;Consumers should properly dispose of these non-working freezers immediately or disable the latch if disposal is impossible. AHAM has set up a special toll-free number (800) 267-3138 from which consumers will be sent detailed information on identifying the affected units and how to dispose of them or disable the latch. Even if a consumer has a pre-1970 chest freezer that is working, they should still call the toll-free number to get information on what to do when the freezer is no longer working. Consumers also can receive information at http://www.aham.org/freezer_safety.htm.&nbsp;Tragically, 27 children have died from suffocation between 1980 and 1999 after becoming trapped in the freezers. The deaths occurred in non-working freezers stored outside, in basements or garages. Victims ranged in age from two to fourteen. In many cases, more than one child suffocated inside the freezer.&nbsp;The freezers that are part of this program were made before 1970 by more than 40 manufacturers, a number of whom do not exist today. Consumers can determine if their chest freezer poses a hazard by trying to open the freezer without using the handle. If the freezer can be opened by pulling up on sides of the lid, it is not a hazard. If the lid only opens by using the handle, it needs to be properly disposed of or disabled.&nbsp;""Many of these old freezers are still sitting in people's basements or abandoned in backyards,"" said CPSC Chairman Ann Brown. ""This is an innovative cooperative effort that helps get safety information to consumers and saves lives.""&nbsp;""We are hopeful this partnership between manufacturers and the government will help save children's lives. We urge all consumers with an affected freezer to dispose of the unit as soon as possible,"" said Joseph M. McGuire, president of AHAM.&nbsp;",,,,Dispose,"Up to 9 million","Tragically, 27 children have died from suffocation between 1980 and 1999 after becoming trapped in the freezers.

98-145,,"July 21, 1998",,"CPSC, Warns That Old Servel Gas Refrigerators Still In Use Can Be Deadly","Servel gas refrigerators","WASHINGTON, D.C. - Government safety experts continue to warn consumers to stop using Servel gas refrigerators manufactured between 1933 and 1957 due to the risk of carbon monoxide leakage in deadly quantities.    The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) reports there have been at least 39 incidents in the U.S. involving these old Servel gas refrigerators, causing 22 carbon monoxide-related deaths and 55 injuries nationwide. There also have been incidents reported in Ontario, Canada, causing 60 deaths.    Because historical sales and distribution records of these early Servel models are unavailable, it is not possible to determine who still owns and uses these refrigerators. The Servels continue to be used in hunting cabins, vacation cottages and remote areas of the nation where there is no electricity, or where gas is the preferred energy source.    Over a period of time, especially if the refrigerator has not been used recently, the gas burner can be fouled by dust, dirt, rust or other obstructions. Any gas refrigerator with an improperly adjusted or partially plugged burner can produce substantial amounts of carbon monoxide.    Consumers can call the Servel Corrective Action Committee (SCAC) toll free at (800) 782-7431 anytime to receive a rebate package that includes instructions for disposing of their Servel gas refrigerator. Consumers who properly dispose of their old Servels will receive a $100 rebate plus reimbursement for reasonable disposal costs.    Since this recall program was launched in 1990, more than 22,000 refrigerators have been destroyed. On average, 100 new requests for rebates are mailed to SCAC monthly, demonstrating that there are still many more in use.    Consumers who insist on keeping their old Servel refrigerators should move them to an outdoor shelter, shed or garage not connected to the house or cottage. CPSC urges owners to secure or restrict access to refrigerators kept outside and, when discarding any refrigerator, to remove its door. This will prevent children from playing in the refrigerator and possibly getting trapped and suffocating inside.    CPSC advises that all gas refrigerators be serviced regularly by licensed technicians in order to assure their safe operation. They also should be inspected after they are moved and before they are turned on after a seasonal shutdown. Special attention should be paid to blockages in burners and flues.    No longer in business, Servel manufactured gas refrigerators between 1933 and 1957. The Servel refrigerators in question are no longer being produced and are in no way associated with the Dometic Corp., the current manufacturer of Servel brand name products.","There have been at least 39 incidents in the U.S. involving these old Servel gas refrigerators, causing 22 carbon monoxide-related deaths and 55 injuries nationwide.

In its Complaint, CPSC alleged that Black &amp; Decker's unilateral recall announcement of October 27, 1997, did not go far enough in notifying the public of the recall or the potential fire hazard associated with the toasters, and the consumer remedy was not adequate. In its Answer, Black &amp; Decker denied the allegations contained in the administrative Complaint. After the Complaint and Answer were filed, CPSC and Black &amp; Decker began working cooperatively to modify and improve Black &amp; Decker's original recall program.    Black &amp; Decker is improving its recall by offering consumers their choice of a free Spacemaker Optima Toaster or other selected replacement product instead of a coupon toward the purchase of a product. Consumers who have already contacted Black &amp; Decker about the toaster recall and used a coupon to purchase another product will now be able to select from a list of replacement Black &amp; Decker products, also for free. Extensive measures are underway to get word of the risk and new remedy to consumers.    The toasters are being recalled because they can allow food to catch on fire, and when the toaster door automatically opens and the food rack extends beyond the door, flames from the food can escape the unit and expose kitchen cabinets and their contents to the fire. When the unilateral recall was first announced, the firm reported 242 incidents. Now Black &amp; Decker has received 1,066 food fire complaints involving these toasters; 656 of these involved property damage ranging from kitchen cabinet damage to one kitchen fire. Eight burn injuries have been reported.    Of approximately 234,000 toasters sold, to date only about 19,000 consumers have participated in the unilateral recall announced last October.    The Black &amp; Decker Spacemaker Optima T1000 Type 1 Horizontal Toasters were sold through retail stores nationwide from 1994 through 1996 for about $50 to $64. Consumers can easily identify these recalled toasters because they are the only Spacemaker Optima Toasters that have an ""OPEN"" button. This ""OPEN"" button is located on the right side of the control panel. The words ""Black &amp; Decker...Spacemaker...Horizontal Toaster...Optima"" appear on the toaster door. ""MODEL NO. T1000 TY1"" is stamped on the back of the toaster. Date codes 405 through 504 appear on the outer prong of the plug blade.    Consumers should stop using these toasters immediately, and contact Black &amp; Decker at (800) 746-2159 between 8 am to 5 pm Eastern Time, Monday through Friday.    Black &amp; Decker is expanding its efforts to notify consumers by mailing letters directly to consumers, purchasing advertising, providing retailers with new safety notices for in-store displays and posting recall information on its web site. Black &amp; Decker is issuing this press release to media outlets nationwide and broadcasting video by satellite so that local television stations can report on this recall announcement by showing the product and the potential fire hazard.    To ensure that the improved recall runs smoothly, Black &amp; Decker also has set up and staffed a special toll-free hotline for consumers to call to participate in this recall.    CPSC believes that for a recall to be effective, people need to know about it and be moved to act on it. CPSC asks companies to use appropriate resources to make sure the public is aware of the hazard associated with a recalled product. With this program, CPSC believes that Black &amp; Decker is now being more aggressive in its attempt to obtain an effective recall. CPSC and Black &amp; Decker, by this modified and improved recall program announced today, strive to ensure that the public is well aware of the risk associated with the toaster. They urge consumers to act quickly and call Black &amp; Decker to participate in the improved recall.","The toasters are being recalled because they can allow food to catch on fire, and when the toaster door automatically opens and the food rack extends beyond the door, flames from the food can escape the unit and expose kitchen cabinets and their contents to the fire.",,,Replace,"About 234,000","When the unilateral recall was first announced, the firm reported 242 incidents.

Models with date codes of ""406"" through ""822"" are being recalled. The date code is a three-digit number on the outside of the plug prong. No other coffeemaker models or other Black &amp; Decker or General Electric products are involved in this recall.    PROBLEM: About 750,000 of four million coffeemakers sold contain thermostats that could present a possible fire hazard.    WHAT TO DO: Consumers owning the specific coffeemakers should bring them to their local Black &amp; Decker Service Centers for inspection. Products with affected thermostats will be repaired free of charge or consumers may purchase a new coffeemaker at 70 percent off. Coffeemakers that do not contain the affected thermostats will be returned to consumers. All consumers participating in this program at Black &amp; Decker-owned Service Centers will be able to purchase other Black &amp; Decker products at a 20 percent discount while having the coffeemakers inspected. Consumers can call (800) 231-9786 for the location of the nearest service center.    WASHINGTON, DC -- Black &amp; Decker Household Products Group, in cooperation with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, announces a voluntary recall of certain Under-the-Cabinet coffeemakers made between 1984 and 1988. Black &amp; Decker is initiating this program because about 750,000 of four million Under-the-Cabinet coffeemakers may contain a thermostat that could present a possible fire hazard.    In accordance with its product safety process, Black &amp; Decker examined Under-the-Cabinet coffeemakers returned by consumers. Approximately 75 showed signs of thermostat damage.    About 45 consumers have reported property damage claims with respect to the Under-the-Cabinet coffeemakers. Property damage allegations range from impairment of the product to varying degrees of residential fire damage. Two consumers claim that they were subject to smoke inhalation. Black &amp; Decker denies claims of any harm beyond damage to the Under-the-Cabinet coffeemaker itself, but is taking this action as a precautionary measure to prevent the possibility of property damage or personal injury.    The SDC 1, 2, and 3 Under-the-Cabinet coffeemakers, produced between February 1984 and May 1988, carry either the Black &amp; Decker or General Electric brand name. Black &amp; Decker purchased the assets of GE Housewares division in 1984 and thereafter produced coffeemakers using the GE brand name from 1984 through 1986. These coffeemakers were originally sold nationwide for between $45 and $72. Black &amp; Decker produced approximately four million Under-the-Cabinet coffeemakers during this time period, of which about 750,000 contained the affected thermostat.    Models with date codes of ""406"" through ""822"" are being recalled. The date code is a three-digit number on the outside of the plug prong, (""652"" date code, for example, falls within the affected range; ""901"" is outside the range). NO other coffeemaker models or other Black &amp; Decker or General Electric products are involved in this recall program.    Individual consumers owning these specific Under-the-Cabinet coffeemaker models should bring them to their local Black &amp; Decker Service Centers for inspection. For those coffeemakers found to have thermostats described above, Black &amp; Decker Household Products Group is offering the consumer two options -- replacement of the affected thermostat and related components by a service center technician at no cost to the consumer, or purchase of a new Black &amp; Decker coffeemaker at 70 percent off. Coffeemakers found not to contain the affected thermostat will be returned to consumers.    Consumers participating in this recall program at Black &amp; Decker-owned Service Centers also will be able to purchase other Black &amp; Decker products at a 20 percent discount, not to be combined with any other offers, while having the coffeemaker inspected.

The recall remedy is not available.      WASHINGTON,DC -- CPSC, Sears Merchandise Group is voluntarily contacting customers regarding 21 Kenmore dishwasher models sold in the last three years that could experience a timer failure that may result in a fire hazard. Sears is providing free service to correct the problem.    Currently, 30 units of about 400,000 units sold have experienced timer failures due to shorting out and overheating. To date, four units have developed fires which resulted in smoke damage to the surrounding countertop and cabinets. Sears has no reports of injuries due to the fires or timer failures.    On February 6, Sears began sending letters to more than 300,000 customers who purchased one of the affected Kenmore dishwasher models made between February 1990 and October 1992. Sears is asking customers who have not yet received letters to check the model of their dishwasher against the list below. Owners of listed models should discontinue using the dishwasher immediately and turn the power off or unlatch the dishwasher's door Model and serial numbers are on the inside right door seal of the dishwasher's tub.    The problem stems from the possibility of units developing an internal leak that may cause the dishwasher's timer mechanism to short out and overheat. Under certain circumstances, an overheated timer can cause a fire. To correct the problem, a Sears service technician will install new parts and inspect and replace other components as needed in the dishwasher door.

This original microwave coffeemaker uses a cone-shaped filter. Under certain circumstances, the cone shaped brewer section may separate from the cup and possibly spill very hot coffee onto the user.    The CPSC was informed of this potential hazard by Mr. Coffee, inc. as a result of three consumer complaints and the company's own concerns about the potential for such separation. This separation may occur because of the extended height of the top brewer and its high center of gravity. There have been no additional reported incidents.    Mr. Coffee's original cone filter style microwave coffeemaker was distributed by Mr. Coffee from May 1990 through early June 1991. Approximately 338,850 units were sold for approximately $10 to $13 each. It was replaced in June 1991 by a new, shorter, basket filter style brewer which also avoids the earlier problem of separation and spills.

92-050,,"February 03, 1992",,"General Electric Intensifies Recall Of Coffeemakers That May Pose A Fire Hazard; Seeks Higher Regional Returns","GE brand and Universal brand drip coffeemakers","WASHINGTON, DC -- The General Electric Company (GE), today announced that it is intensifying its recall of certain GE brand and Universal brand drip coffeemakers manufactured before April 28, 1984.    GE, in cooperation with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), launched a voluntary recall of these units in March 1991. They want to remind consumers that these coffeemakers could represent a significant fire hazard and that consumers in many areas of the U.S. still have not returned their units.    The company believes that a fire hazard may occur when a supplier's thermal fuse in the coffeemaker fails to function as intended. About nine million drip coffeemakers bearing the GE or Universal brand name were manufactured between 1976 and 1984.    GE has received approximately 500 reports of coffeemakers overheating. It has been alleged that one fire caused by a fuse failure resulted in two fatalities and serious personal injury to eight other people. GE has received claims that fuse failures also may have been responsible for fires that resulted in three additional deaths and 17 personal injuries. Approximately 380 of the claims involve property damage ranging in value from $300 to $1.3 million.    As an incentive, GE is offering owners $10 for each recalled unit returned. A $10 check will be mailed when a unit is received by GE. GE will give consumers with recalled coffeemakers pre-paid mailing cartons. The carton will contain instructions that will tell consumers how to arrange for convenient pick-up. This innovative method of recall is aimed at reducing consumer effort and increasing the rate of return.    No units made on or after April 28, 1984 are involved in this recall. To determine the date of manufacture, check the date code number stamped on the outside metal blade of the electric plug. If the number is 418 through 600, the coffeemaker is not involved in this recall. Other GE brand and Universal brand drip coffeemakers which are not involved in the recall are:    - Space Maker Drip Coffeemakers (catalog numbers that include the designations SDC1, SDC2, and SDC3)    - Percolators    Owners of a GE brand or Universal brand drip coffeemaker are asked to read both the catalog number on the bottom of the unit and the date code stamped on the outside of the metal blades of the electric plug. If the coffeemaker is a recalled unit, consumers should call toll-free 1-800-443-9000.

The CPSC has also urged consumers to destroy all food that has been preserved using a Micro-Dome Food Preserver.    Consumers who sent in warranty registration cards should have received materials explaining how to return the product for a $50 rebate. However, the rebate program is no longer available and the company may be out of business. Do not use these products. Please discard or destroy these products    The Micro-Dome Food Preserver is used in microwave ovens to preserve fruits, vegetables and prepared dishes. The appliance is a plastic container that can process one standard metal lidded canning jar at a time. Generally priced at $50, approximately 18,600 units were sold to customers.    Micro-Dome informed the Commission that the top of the plastic container may blow off in the microwave if the vent stem or safety release becomes plugged. The pressurized plastic container may also explode during or after removal from the microwave, or if the container is hit or dropped. Furthermore, the plastic container may also crack and/or develop lines (called crazing) that could increase the risk of explosion. Explosion of a pressurized Micro-Dome containing hot water and food could cause severe injuries such as blindness and burns from flying fragments and liquids.    Micro-Dome reported 29 incidents involving the cracking and/or crazing of the plastic container, eight incidents of the top blowing off, and four incidents of the vent being plugged without the blow plug releasing. One injury was reported involving a user who sustained minor burns when the top of the container blew off. The CPSC recommends that consumers not use the Micro-Dome Food Preserver. It should be returned to Micro- Dome for the rebate or destroyed and disposed of in such a manner that it cannot be used in the future.    CPSC is also concerned about possible food poisoning in certain foods prepared using the Micro-Dome Microwave Food Preserver. While CPSC is unaware of any incidents of food poisoning, it is concerned that the product and its accompanying recipe and instruction booklet do not adequately ensure the safety of certain canned foods. In addition to possibly failing to kill bacteria while the food in the Micro-Dome is cooked in a microwave oven, food also can be contaminated after cooking. Eating improperly preserved food can cause serious illness such as botulism. The toxin which causes botulism is the most potent natural poison in the world. Even one taste could be fatal.

The food processors involved are models LM2 (La Machine II), LM3 (La Machine III), LM5 (La Machine V), and the JC Penney model 8330. The machines were manufactured from 1980 to June 8, 1984.    Regal is alerting owners to the potential failure of the product's safety interlock system. When this occurs, the machine can operate without the bowl cover in place. This could cause severe lacerations to the hands and fingers, or even partial finger amputations, should the user push the ""on"" button when the hand is in the bowl and in contact with the machine's cutting blades.    The firm has received 17 reports of finger or hand lacerations, and 4 reports of partial finger amputations, from 1982 to February, 1986. These incidents reportedly have resulted from the use of the machine.    Regal Appliance Inc., is offering to replace the original bowl cover on affected machines with a new bowl cover. The new bowl cover is designed to reduce the chance that an operator will accidentally force the cover off of the machine and defeat the interlock.    Owners of La Machine II, III, or V food processors can determine if their unit is recalled by checking the bottom for the stamped model numbers LM2, LM3, or LM5, and for a date code from 010380 to 080684. The six digit date code is in day, month, and year sequence. Owners of JC Penney food processors should check the bottom of their unit for the stamped model number 8330 and for a date code from COO3 to C406. The first digit of the C number represents the year and the last two digits represent the month. Only units with the listed model numbers and date codes have bowl covers subject to recall. Food processors made after June 8, 1984, including all La Machine I (LMl model) units, are not subject to the recall.    Regal advises owners of recalled food processors to discontinue use of their machine until a replacement bowl cover is received. The original bowl cover should be disposed of. To get the replacement, owners should write to the Bowl Cover Replacement Program, Regal Appliance Inc., 2820 Crusader Circle, Virginia Beach, Virginia 23456. The letter must include the name and address of the owner and the model and date code numbers of the machine. The company will promptly return the new replacement bowl cover to the owner, free of charge, with a warning instruction sheet.    The La Machine and JC Penney food processors were sold nationwide by a variety of retailers and by the JC Penney Co. since March, 1980, for about $50 to $100.

79-046,,"September 03, 1979",,"Major Corrective Action Set On Corning Ware Coffee Percolators","Corning Ware coffee percolators","WASHINGTON, D.C. (Sept. 4) -- Corning Glass Works and the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission today announced a voluntary action by the company to remove virtually all Corning Ware coffee percolators from consumer use.    Some of these coffeemakers can be dangerous to use because the handle and metal band may separate without warning from the white glass-ceramic pot.    Consumers owning Corning Ware percolators are advised to stop using them immediately. If such a separation occurs on a coffeemaker containing hot liquid, the consumer can be burned.    As part of its voluntary corrective action, Corning has prepared an incentive program to get consumers to stop using these coffeemakers. The company has purchased advertising space in hundreds of newspapers nationwide telling consumers what to do.    The advertisements, scheduled to appear beginning September 10th, will contain coupons through which coffeemaker owners may obtain details from Corning regarding the plan. Consumers also may receive information concerning the program from Corning Glass Works, P.O. BOX 5750, Corning, New York 14830, but are requested to use the coupons which will be appearing in their local newspapers. The Commission has accepted Corning's Corrective action Plan.    Corning has manufactured and sold approximately 18.5 million Corning Ware percolators since they were introduced in 1960. Due to normal product attrition, a smaller number is believed to be still in use.    In 1976 Corning recalled approximately 400,000 electromatic percolators manufactured in 1974. With respect to its other percolators, since 1972 Corning has received approximately 7,000 separation complaints including reports of approximately 1,250 injuries. Corning said these represent approximately 4 complaints and 0.7 injury complaints per 10,000 percolators sold.    Corning said that these rates are low, but it has decided voluntarily to remove the percolators from service rather than risk any further injuries or inconvenience on the part of its customers.    The cause of the separation problem has been traced to the epoxy sealant which was intended to fasten the handle/metal band assembly to the white glass-ceramic pot. This sealant can dry out and become brittle, causing the two parts to separate without warning.    The separation problem does not extend to Corning's ""Pyrex"" brand clear glass percolators or to any other Corning coffeemakers, and those products are not included in the program, Corning said.    The Commission and Corning request that consumers not return coffeemakers to the company or to retailers. They should be taken out of use immediately and retained until the owner receives instructions on the program from Corning.

(Feb. 3) -- The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) today announced the recall of approximately 14,500 Nobility-brand 10-cup Automatic Coffeemakers, Model #151, because they pose a potential fire hazard.    According to the Commission staff, a defect in the internal construction may cause corrosion of the metal bracket which holds the thermostat against the heating element. When this happens, the thermostat will fall away from the heating element and the unit will remain in a constant ""On"" position, generating unnecessary heat until it ignites the plastic case.    Consumers who own a Nobility coffeemaker, Model #151, should stop use immediately and return the unit to the store where purchased for a full refund. All coffeemakers involved in the recall have the name ""NOBILITY"" written across the front of the upper section of the unit where the water is added. Etched into the metal plate at the base of each coffeemaker are the words: UL LISTED 4293, MADE IN SINGAPORE, DO NOT IMMERSE IN WATER, and E57635 MODEL 232. (This model number is not to be confused with Model #151 which is printed only on the box in which the coffeemaker is packaged). The units have been sold nationwide under the Nobility name since approximately June 1976, and retailed for about $16.50.    These same coffeemakers have been imported and distributed by other as yet unidentified firms under different brand names. All units, however, bear the same inscriptions on the base plate.

(June 8) - The Consumer Product Safety Commission Friday said it has learned from the Tappan Company of a defect in certain Tappan Company built-in gas ovens manufactured for installation primarily in mobile homes and other newly constructed homes.    The Commission said the defect --a possible loose fitting connection-- could result in a hazard to consumers from gas leakage. The ovens in question were manufactured between January 23, 1973, and May 31, 1973, by the F.H. Lawson Company, Springfield, Tennessee, for the Tappan Company.    While the majority of the ovens carry the ""Tappan"" name, some were produced for Montgomery Ward and carry the brand-name ""Signature.""    According to Tappan, the problem occurred in some 15,185 ovens, of which 11,974 have been shipped from the place of manufacture.    The ovens carry model numbers AZ12-1239; AZ12-1249; AZ12-1441; AKTM-3850; and AKTM-3893. Some 8,172 of the ovens-- model number AZ12-1239-- are used exclusively in mobile homes.    The Montgomery Ward ovens--""Signature""--carry the ""AKTM"" model number prefix.    CPSC Chairman Richard 0. Simpson said the Commission is asking wholesalers, distributors, and retailers who may have the affected ovens in stock or installed in mobile homes or newly constructed homes immediately to contact the Tappan Company.  In addition, Simpson said consumers who may have purchased a Tappan or ""Signature"" built-in oven with one of the model numbers in question should contact their local gas company or the nearest Tappan dealer regarding possible gas leakage between the shut-off valve and the pressure regulator.    The Commission was told by Tappan that consumers can locate the model number on the oven by opening the top oven door and looking at the metal strip at the top of the oven which carries the model number on it.    CPSC investigators have been sent to the Tappan headquarters, Mansfield, Ohio, and to the F.H. Lawson Company to determine whether the remedial action proposed by Tappan is appropriate and to determine the degree of potential hazard to consumers.","A possible loose fitting connection could result in a hazard to consumers from gas leakage.",,,"No Remedy Available",,,"CPSC Chairman Richard 0.
